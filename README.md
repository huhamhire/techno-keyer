# Techno Keyer

*Techno Keyer* is an autonomous CW keyer with encode/decode abilities for amateur radio (ham radio) enthusiasts to send out morse codes with USB keyboards.

> ‚Ñπ Ô∏è This repository only contains firmware implementation for *Techno Keyer*. The hardware design and schematics are not included. 

> The design of *Techno Keyer* comes with a VFD (vacuum fluorescent display) module, which makes it feels more like other vintage electronic devices from 1980s. Because of this idea, the word "Techno" seems to be a good fit for naming this project.


## Features

1. **Display**
   - 16x2 VFD display for messages and status.
   - Blue LED for CW key output status.
   - Red LED for audio input status.

2. **TX Mode**
   - Transmit morse code by input form USB keyboard.
   - Work as a straight key by the 3.5mm key port.
   - Display input messages on VFD before sending out.

3. **RX Mode**
   - Receive morse code (CW) audio signal from radio or other source.
   - Decode and display messages received on VFD.
   - Select specific pitch frequency for audio input.

4. **Configurable**
   - Set CW speed (10-50 WPM) for transmitting.
   - Set VFD brightness.
   - Set pitch frequency (400-1000Hz) for buzzer output (TX & RX mode).
