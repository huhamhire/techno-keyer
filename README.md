# Techno Keyer

*Techno Keyer* is an autonomous CW (continuous wave) keyer with encode/decode abilities for amateur radio (ham radio) enthusiasts to send out morse codes with USB keyboards.

> ‚Ñπ Ô∏è This repository only contains firmware implementation of *Techno Keyer*. The hardware design and schematics are not included. 

> The design of *Techno Keyer* comes with a VFD (vacuum fluorescent display) module, which makes it feels more like other vintage electronic devices from 1980s. Because of this idea, the word "Techno" seems to be a good fit for naming this project.


## Features

1. **Dimension**: 115mm (W) x 52mm (D) x 45mm (H)

2. **Display**
   - 16x2 VFD display for messages and status.
   - Blue LED for CW key output status.
   - Red LED for audio input status.

3. **TX Mode**
   - Transmit morse code by input form USB keyboard.
   - Work as a straight key by the 3.5mm key port.
   - Display input messages on VFD before sending out.

4. **RX Mode**
   - Receive morse code (CW) audio signal from radio or other source.
   - Decode and display messages received on VFD.
   - Select specific pitch frequency for audio input.

5. **Configurable**
   - Set CW speed (10-50 WPM) for transmitting.
   - Set VFD brightness.
   - Set pitch frequency (400-1000Hz) for buzzer output (TX & RX mode).


## User Guide

1. **Power On**
   - Connect USB Type-C cable to power the *Techno Keyer* on.
   - The VFD will display the welcome message.
   - After 2 seconds, the keyer will enter the transmit (TX) mode.

2. **Send Morse Code**
   - Plug USB keyboard to the Type-A port.
   - Connect radio to the 3.5mm key port, set key mode as straight key.
   - Use the USB keyboard to input messages.
   - Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key to send out the message in morse code.
   - Press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key to retract the last word.

3. **Decode Audio Input**
   - Connect audio source to the 3.5mm audio input jack.
   - Rotate the rotary encoder to adjust the centering pitch frequency.
   - The *Techno Keyer* will decode morse code from audio signal matching target pitch frequency automatically.
   - The decoded messages will be displayed on the VFD, and the *Techno Keyer* would entering the receive (RX) mode.

4. **Config Settings**
   - Press the rotary encoder button to enter the configuration mode.
   - Press the encoder button again to select the setting to change.
   - Rotate the encoder to change value of selected setting.
   - The settings include:
     - VFD brightness (0-100%)
     - TX Speed - CW speed for transmit mode (10-50 WPM)
     - TX Tone - Pitch frequency for transmit mode (400-1000Hz)
     - RX Tone - Pitch frequency for receive mode (400-1000Hz)
   - After configuring the last menu item, press the encoder button to save and exit the configuration mode, all changes made would be saved.

5. **Other Functions**
   - The buzzer could be turned off by the switch beside the USB type-C port.
   - Press the rotary encoder button for 3 seconds to restart the keyer.

> ‚Ñπ Ô∏è Note: 
> - If TX mode is active, the audio input will be blocked for 3 seconds after sending out the last character.
> - If RX mode is active, the keyboard input will be blocked for 3 seconds.
